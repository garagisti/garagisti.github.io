I dedicate my first ever blog post to my son Lucas and my darling wife (whose name I shall withold from this blog until I recieve the appropriate permission):

So this is the first ever post on my blog. I don't think its the first time I've ever written about anything that's on my mind.
I'm sure I have...

...I suppose there are a few reasons for this blog thing to come about.

1. Pull my finger out...
2. I've never been one to be outspoken or speak up in large crowds. Not that I'm going to start now, but at least I have an avenue to vent.
3. I've been passionate about many things, but rarely have I expressed my views on them. Perhaps related to my introvertedness expressed in point 1 above.
4. Not saying that I'm ready for the world, or the world is ready for me. But I just want todo the things I'm passionate about.
5. No matter what I do in my career the terms 'transferrable skills' have never meant more than they do now. Especially with such a great technology community (in my home city!). I am only now at a stage where I can 'take a punt' to give it a real go.

So here goes.
