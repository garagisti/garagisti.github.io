It's been a long time between drinks. A lot has happened in my personal life I suppose.

Anyway, the new outlook is to get things back on track and start blogging about the things I want to focus on.

So let's begin. Again.

This blog is an outline about how to send emails using terminal. There's obviously more you would want to do than simply sending emails, such as scheduling emails, and adding useful content to these emails. Such as, The F1 practice session is on tonight, and here's some detail about who won last year, the fastest times etc. etc.

For now, let's just focus on sending emails.

Basically, we will be using a pre-established gmail account to act as the sever to send emails.
