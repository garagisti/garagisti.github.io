A couple of obvious things I should clear up first...

What is garagisti? - Per the definition above - yes it's source is dubious, but the sentiment is cool! And I can almost visualise the great man saying something like that!

Why? - Its just something I took inspiration from a long time ago, and it's somehow gaining in relevance...

I'm no stranger to tech. I worked for a well known tech company once upon a time. But I left to expand my career and life skills.

Today the tech community is different to what it was, and after all is said and done, I just missed tech too much.

There's more to me than tech though. I love my wife and son. I love my F1, I love cricket (all formats) and love to dabble in other ball sports.

Sometimes I love to cook (rainy days are awesome for slow cooked [insert meat here] ).

Anyway, that's a good breakdown. I'm sure i'll continue to add to this over time.
