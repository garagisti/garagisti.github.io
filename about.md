A couple of obvious things I should clear up first...

What is garagisti?

Why?

I'm no stranger to tech. I worked for a well known tech company once upon a time. But I left to expand my career and ilfe skills.

Today the tech community is different to what it was, and after all is said and done, I just missed tech too much.

There's more to me than tech though. I love my wife and son. I love my F1, I love cricket (all formats) and love to dabble in other ball sports.

Sometimes I love to cook (rainy days are awesome for slow cooked "<insert meat here>" ).
